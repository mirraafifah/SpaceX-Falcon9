# SpaceX-Falcon9

## Project background 
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. If we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

## Objectives
- Determine the price of each launch.
- Determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. 
- Train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

## Summary of methodologies
- Data Collection (API and Web scraping)
- Data Wrangling
- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysist) with SQL and Visualization (Python)
- Interactive Visual Analytics (Folium)
- Machine Learning Prediction

## Summary of all results
- Result from EDA
- Dashboard (Ploty & Dash)
- Result from Predictive Analysist
